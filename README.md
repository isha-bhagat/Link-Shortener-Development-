# Link-Shortener-Development-
# Link Shortener Project

This project is part of my Java programming internship. The goal is to create a simple application that converts long URLs into short, unique links, making them easier to share. I'll use Java to build this tool, focusing on generating unique short URLs and handling any errors that might occur, such as duplicate URLs or invalid inputs.

The project involves creating functions to shorten long URLs and expand them back to their original form. I'll implement a basic hash function to generate the short URLs and ensure their uniqueness. Additionally, I'll develop a command-line interface (CLI) to allow users to interact with the application easily.

This project provides practical experience in Java programming, data structures, and basic algorithms. It also helps me understand how to manage user input, handle errors, and provide meaningful feedback. Overall, it's a valuable learning opportunity to develop my skills in Java and web development.
